For all containers on same machine run these two commands:

docker network create --driver bridge app-network

docker-compose up --build




In case we need it on seperate devices may have to run commands like this:

docker swarm init --advertise-addr <Manager-Machine-IP> # run on manager machine

docker swarm join --token <Swarm-Token> <Manager-Machine-IP>:2377 # run on other two machines

docker network create --driver overlay app-network # run on manager machine

docker-compose up react-app # probably manager machine

docker-compose up spring-boot-app # probably one other machine

docker-compose up db-app # probably one other machine

sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp  # For the React app machine
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp  # For the Spring Boot machine
sudo ufw allow 8081/tcp  # For the SQLite DB machine

http://<React-Machine-IP>:3000
